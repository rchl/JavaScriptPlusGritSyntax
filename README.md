# JavaScriptPlusGritSyntax
Extension of original JavaScript syntax to support grit preprocessor `<if expr="...">...</if>` blocks.

`<if expr="False">` blocks have special handling in that they are shown as visually disabled.

## Usage
Open JS file and set the `JavaScript (+Grit)` syntax for it.

It's recommended to use `Open all with current extension as...` option so that this syntax
is automatically applied to all JavaScript files.

Due to original syntax being referenced from this one, all updates to original one
will automatically be included so it's safe to just use this syntax for all JavaScript files.
